# Chapter 8 HTTP

- The World Wide Web is a major distributed system, with millions of users. 
    A site may become a Web host by running an HTTP server.
 While Web clients are typically users with a browser, there are many other "user agents" such as web spiders, web application clients and so on.
- The Web is built on top of the HTTP (Hyper-Text Transport Protocol) which is layered on top of TCP.
 HTTP has been through three publicly available versions, but the latest - version 1.1 - is now the most commonly used.
