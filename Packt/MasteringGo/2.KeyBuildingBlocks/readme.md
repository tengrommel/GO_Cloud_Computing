#Key Building Blocks

- Reviewing binary search algorithm
- Implementing binary search in Go by recursion
- Implementing binary search in GO by iteration

**Logic for Binary Search**
- Target is to search for an item in an array
- Get the middle item of the array
- If more than the desired value => First item till the middle item
- If less than the desired value => Middle item till the end item
- Repeat the process
